Delivering a Smart City management system developed in C++ involves several tools. There are tools for linting, testing and building a production ready artifact. For linting the project, clang-format and clang-tidy are popular tools to ensure compliance with some given syntactic style, from these options, clang-tidy not only verifies the correct formatting of the project files but also performs a deeper inspection to prevent common bad practices that would result in hard-to-debug issues, therefore, clang-tidy is the chosen one. For testing the code, GoogleTest is a well documented framework for testing and mocking C++ code that covers any type of tests, not only unit tests and its usage is similar to other popular tools like JUnit or PyUnit, and moreover, GoogleTest is chosen for this project because is continuously maintained as appreciable it its public GitHub repository. For building the project codebase in C++, Ninja is an efficient tool that takes the output of build generators like CMake and turns them into executables by taking advantage of the CPU cores of the host.

After the project is built, CI can be set up with tools like CruiseControl, TeamCity or Hudson, besides other tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions. These tools do a good job, but TeamCity has gained more popularity over the others due to it being easier to setup and manage, which is crucial for an extensive project as a Smart City management system.

Due to high security risks involved in Smart City management, the best option to isolate and have full control over the project's environment is to perform CI as a self-hosted service.
